// I apologize this is not my best work and it is already after the time for when this is due. 
// I am out of practice with Tailwind CSS and spent way more time than I should have to refresh 
// myself on it. PHP is another thing I don't use often so I don't have it all memorized. My 
// thought process was simple on this project. I was planning a minimal style page. One thing I 
// would have liked to add was a 3D model of a rocket ship using Three.js on the banner. 
// Currently, I have a gif, but I would have liked to replace that with a 3D model that rotates 
// similarly. My search bar works on text change, so no need to press a button. Since the data is 
// already loaded and stored it was easy to search through the data. I was a bit confused about 
// the filter since the way I understood it was as a sorting tool, but the terminology was 
// filtered, I did make it into a sorting tool. Lastly, I was planning to add animation to most 
// things. After a new item changes in the search bar or if the filter changes I wanted the 
// results to animate upwards and fade in. These were some of my plans for the site, but since 
// some stuff doesnâ€™t translate correctly to Tailwind I would need to go back and review the 
// logic and how some styles work again in order to fix this the way I wanted it. On my Github 
// I have examples of what I have been working on and what I am capable of, but I do understand 
// if that is not expectable. Thank you for this opportunity.
